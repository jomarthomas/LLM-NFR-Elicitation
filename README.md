# LLM-NFR-Elicitation
This repository contains the codebase, datasets, and documentation for a research project aimed at automating the elicitation of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) from Functional Requirements (FRs) using Large Language Models (LLMs). It features a JavaScript-based implementation for preprocessing, LLM integration, and evaluation.
