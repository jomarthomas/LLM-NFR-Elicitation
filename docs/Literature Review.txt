Purpose
The literature review will establish a theoretical foundation for the research by exploring existing work in requirements engineering, particularly in automating Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) elicitation. It will identify gaps, methodologies, and tools relevant to integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into requirements engineering.

Key Topics to Explore
NFR Elicitation Methodologies:

Traditional approaches to eliciting NFRs from stakeholders and functional requirements.
Common challenges, such as ambiguity, incompleteness, and lack of domain knowledge.
Applications of LLMs in Software Engineering:

Prior research on using LLMs for requirements analysis, refinement, or generation.
Techniques for prompt engineering and domain adaptation in LLMs.
Challenges in Automating Requirements Elicitation:

Limitations of automated tools in handling complex, domain-specific requirements.
Issues of trust, reliability, and adoption in AI-driven requirements engineering.
Evaluation Strategies in Requirements Engineering:

Metrics and benchmarks commonly used to evaluate NFR quality (e.g., clarity, relevance).
Frameworks such as Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) in empirical studies.
